WEBVTT

0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.250
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:0:-6.-820 --> 0:0:8.970
<v Wright, Steve>Thing where like I'm like I just need to quickly generate something and I'll just do a quick call to check because the VTT files that OneDrive creates are different from the VTT files that teams create, it would appear.</v>

0:0:10.20 --> 0:0:14.490
<v Hurst, Peter>That would make some sense thinking about it, because the implemented former.</v>

0:0:15.510 --> 0:0:19.20
<v Wright, Steve>Except there is a standard and neither of them conformed to the station.</v>

0:0:18.340 --> 0:0:19.670
<v Hurst, Peter>No, that was.</v>

0:0:20.450 --> 0:0:21.40
<v Hurst, Peter>Like this to be.</v>

0:0:23.360 --> 0:0:24.850
<v Wright, Steve>It's like it's like, you know.</v>

0:0:25.840 --> 0:0:30.210
<v Wright, Steve>The the constant feeling of this is life as an unpaid Microsoft beta tester.</v>

0:0:30.510 --> 0:0:33.940
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah. Yeah, cause the transcription button turned up.</v>

0:0:34.980 --> 0:0:37.220
<v Hurst, Peter>Who were good a good six months before the.</v>

0:0:38.280 --> 0:0:40.900
<v Hurst, Peter>Transcription generation in.</v>

0:0:42.930 --> 0:0:43.790
<v Hurst, Peter>In OneDrive.</v>

0:0:44.480 --> 0:0:50.280
<v Hurst, Peter>Because that was one of the things that we held them off for for ages before they forced us over to stream. It's a new stream, sorry.</v>

0:0:50.720 --> 0:0:51.210
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah.</v>

0:0:53.30 --> 0:0:53.580
<v Wright, Steve>Ohh.</v>

0:0:52.980 --> 0:1:2.110
<v Hurst, Peter>Held off for a second. I I didn't get a contact. I haven't. I haven't mentioned this yet. When I said there were still chasing it, I put a comment in the 365 MANAGERS group about the fact that.</v>

0:1:2.830 --> 0:1:3.280
<v Hurst, Peter>Umm.</v>

0:1:4.100 --> 0:1:10.110
<v Hurst, Peter>Will this be like transcription, where it's delayed, delayed, delayed. Then it works and then we change over and now it's not working again?</v>

0:1:10.880 --> 0:1:28.600
<v Hurst, Peter>And uh, the account director or whatever he is, he said. What do you mean said it's not working. We've had this since October and here's a link to the page on the Internet where you ask what you're being asked about it and your people say, oh, yeah, we can see that's problem. We're looking into it.</v>

0:1:29.440 --> 0:1:30.160
<v Hurst, Peter>And we've got it.</v>

0:1:30.910 --> 0:1:35.230
<v Hurst, Peter>And that our staff are happy about it because obviously we're not being able to transcribe stuff.</v>

0:1:36.80 --> 0:1:38.370
<v Hurst, Peter>Oh, I'll look into it. I'll go to the product team.</v>

0:1:40.430 --> 0:1:41.820
<v Hurst, Peter>But so far they've not fixed it.</v>

0:1:43.670 --> 0:1:44.620
<v Hurst, Peter>The game is one thing.</v>

0:1:45.660 --> 0:1:45.860
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:1:43.660 --> 0:1:49.630
<v Wright, Steve>No, but I mean it seems to work sometimes, so I've I I've I've managed to get 2 files transcribed and three not.</v>

0:1:49.910 --> 0:1:58.990
<v Hurst, Peter>Well, that was it. They went away for a week and came back and said Ohh try it now so I tried it. It didn't work to try it again so I pressed it again and magically it worked on the second press.</v>

0:1:59.660 --> 0:2:3.240
<v Hurst, Peter>And it's like, oh, it's working now. So I tried another one thinking how that's just look.</v>

0:2:3.920 --> 0:2:12.590
<v Hurst, Peter>And the next one worked. The next one worked. Just I think it's fixed now. So OK, then we'll try it. And then yeah, it wasn't fixed. It does exactly what you said.</v>

0:2:21.0 --> 0:2:21.340
<v Hurst, Peter>Is it?</v>

0:2:11.530 --> 0:2:24.980
<v Wright, Steve>The other thing is they've they've they've now added it. So it was previously it was only in stream, but now it's also just straight in OneDrive under video details and it wasn't there and it's like it. How do you do this?</v>

0:2:24.390 --> 0:2:26.570
<v Hurst, Peter>They have put it. Oh, that's new. I didn't know it was there.</v>

0:2:27.200 --> 0:2:29.500
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah, so if I.</v>

0:2:32.880 --> 0:2:36.920
<v Wright, Steve>Now let's see share screen and get rid of you.</v>

0:2:43.510 --> 0:2:43.800
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:2:46.540 --> 0:2:47.470
<v Hurst, Peter>That's the camera.</v>

0:2:37.800 --> 0:2:48.590
<v Wright, Steve>A heights. I hate it when people share their screen and it's me looking at me the opposite way round and I have two versions of me while we're on the right of the screen. What we're on the left and it's just massively confusing.</v>

0:2:49.120 --> 0:2:49.480
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:2:55.770 --> 0:2:58.610
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah. So if I go here now.</v>

0:3:0.30 --> 0:3:2.70
<v Wright, Steve>And click on one of these.</v>

0:3:5.110 --> 0:3:6.420
<v Wright, Steve>If you go.</v>

0:3:7.210 --> 0:3:11.430
<v Hurst, Peter>That's where I always do. Good to go is in into the additional features when they're loaded, yeah.</v>

0:3:13.530 --> 0:3:14.740
<v Wright, Steve>Ah, so it's generated.</v>

0:3:15.240 --> 0:3:15.560
<v Hurst, Peter>Alright.</v>

0:3:15.980 --> 0:3:20.290
<v Wright, Steve>So this one has generated this morning, but here now if you go to video details.</v>

0:3:20.530 --> 0:3:20.850
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:3:22.690 --> 0:3:24.760
<v Wright, Steve>You can generate a transcript here.</v>

0:3:25.450 --> 0:3:26.530
<v Hurst, Peter>Yes, sometime.</v>

0:3:27.260 --> 0:3:28.650
<v Hurst, Peter>That's the bit that I work.</v>

0:3:26.130 --> 0:3:30.110
<v Wright, Steve>And there's generate. Whereas previously you had to go to stream.</v>

0:3:30.810 --> 0:3:32.820
<v Wright, Steve>To generate the the transcript.</v>

0:3:32.980 --> 0:3:33.800
<v Hurst, Peter>Alright ohh I'd.</v>

0:3:34.620 --> 0:3:35.570
<v Hurst, Peter>Now, I've never used that.</v>

0:3:36.120 --> 0:3:38.940
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah. So I was trying it via stream.</v>

0:3:42.340 --> 0:3:43.110
<v Hurst, Peter>That's interesting.</v>

0:3:42.890 --> 0:3:45.560
<v Wright, Steve>So that's now working OK, so it's worked on that.</v>

0:3:44.960 --> 0:3:49.630
<v Hurst, Peter>Well I, that's the bit that button is the thing that doesn't work sometimes that I've been.</v>

0:3:50.350 --> 0:3:51.460
<v Hurst, Peter>That they're still looking at.</v>

0:3:52.320 --> 0:3:52.850
<v Wright, Steve>Right.</v>

0:3:52.890 --> 0:3:55.830
<v Hurst, Peter>That. Yeah, but you still do sometimes get that. Sorry.</v>

0:3:54.950 --> 0:3:57.740
<v Wright, Steve>And this one's worked as well. But see I was going.</v>

0:3:58.860 --> 0:4:0.50
<v Wright, Steve>Go here.</v>

0:4:0.950 --> 0:4:5.460
<v Wright, Steve>I when I've written like guidance right? I said open open in stream.</v>

0:4:7.140 --> 0:4:10.800
<v Wright, Steve>And then you open in stream and stream had the.</v>

0:4:14.210 --> 0:4:14.420
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:4:11.530 --> 0:4:20.260
<v Wright, Steve>Transcript button so it had a very clear button that said generated transcript, but then it came back it it either was under video details or wasn't.</v>

0:4:21.430 --> 0:4:22.190
<v Hurst, Peter>Interesting.</v>

0:4:23.90 --> 0:4:24.630
<v Hurst, Peter>No, I haven't that way of working.</v>

0:4:23.290 --> 0:4:26.630
<v Wright, Steve>So this is the stream interface and here.</v>

0:4:27.150 --> 0:4:27.470
<v Hurst, Peter>Yes.</v>

0:4:27.870 --> 0:4:34.390
<v Wright, Steve>You have a video details and you click general, so that's that's that's that's create and transcripts this morning no problem.</v>

0:4:34.710 --> 0:4:48.110
<v Hurst, Peter>Interesting. Well, they did tell. They sent me an update on they sent me an update every week saying we're sorry. There's no update, which I haven't bored you with. But I did get an update on Friday saying we're hoping to have an update on Wednesday.</v>

0:4:49.110 --> 0:4:57.400
<v Hurst, Peter>I got another update this morning from somebody saying the person who's been updating me is away from an avoidable reasons, but we're still working on your problem so.</v>

0:4:58.280 --> 0:5:2.300
<v Hurst, Peter>Still not sure I'll get an update tomorrow, but maybe they, maybe they're actually out what it is, Atlas.</v>

0:5:6.990 --> 0:5:7.420
<v Hurst, Peter>OK.</v>

0:5:3.280 --> 0:5:10.570
<v Wright, Steve>So it looks like they have now. So all three videos that I submitted this morning I have now got transcripts from them.</v>

0:5:11.150 --> 0:5:11.450
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:5:11.740 --> 0:5:12.600
<v Wright, Steve>UM.</v>

0:5:16.360 --> 0:5:17.180
<v Wright, Steve>But lost.</v>

0:5:18.630 --> 0:5:19.910
<v Wright, Steve>So that's a change.</v>

0:5:20.340 --> 0:5:20.590
<v Hurst, Peter>Yep.</v>

0:5:22.230 --> 0:5:25.110
<v Hurst, Peter>But that is the VTT. What does the VTT do?</v>

0:5:25.50 --> 0:5:28.100
<v Wright, Steve>For that. Yeah. So the next step is looking at.</v>

0:5:36.370 --> 0:5:36.660
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:5:42.500 --> 0:5:43.30
<v Hurst, Peter>I thought be.</v>

0:5:30.50 --> 0:5:47.50
<v Wright, Steve>The the difference is it are there any differences in the VTT files? Which is why I wanted to record this meeting in order to get a teams live BTT and then try and put that through the two different converters and see if we can figure out how to figure. I mean The thing is what? What's?</v>

0:5:48.870 --> 0:5:49.170
<v Wright, Steve>Look.</v>

0:5:50.270 --> 0:5:50.680
<v Wright, Steve>The.</v>

0:5:54.330 --> 0:5:54.990
<v Wright, Steve>The.</v>

0:5:55.830 --> 0:5:58.640
<v Wright, Steve>The challenge for me is that so.</v>

0:5:59.830 --> 0:6:1.80
<v Wright, Steve>I've worked with.</v>

0:6:18.930 --> 0:6:20.400
<v Hurst, Peter>Ohh excellent. Yeah, yeah.</v>

0:6:1.950 --> 0:6:21.140
<v Wright, Steve>Closely with that, that's TI on this sent them examples and teams sent them examples from OneDrive and they've just sorted it. They've just built a VTT importer into their software. That just brings seamlessly use press. Add the video, press 1 button, add the VTT cleans it up completely, synchronizes the whole thing, gives you really nice editing environment.</v>

0:6:22.220 --> 0:6:29.400
<v Wright, Steve>But nvivo, because they sell a transcription service, which is far as I can make out, uses Azure.</v>

0:6:29.940 --> 0:6:30.450
<v Hurst, Peter>Probably.</v>

0:6:30.330 --> 0:6:32.900
<v Wright, Steve>But but they charge you a lot of money for.</v>

0:6:33.820 --> 0:6:36.860
<v Wright, Steve>Have no interest in making this work.</v>

0:6:53.390 --> 0:6:53.600
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:6:37.930 --> 0:6:58.100
<v Wright, Steve>Because that would rival their paid for service. So so. So from them you have to do a load of work to clean the file up and get it ready for import. You can do it from word online, but word online has got a limit on the number of minutes per month. I haven't seen that evidenced in OneDrive, but I don't know if it's an implicit limit.</v>

0:6:58.740 --> 0:7:0.470
<v Hurst, Peter>I've never seen anybody hit it.</v>

0:7:1.920 --> 0:7:7.20
<v Hurst, Peter>Perseis, I assume there's something that will pop up and say now you've done it now.</v>

0:7:7.650 --> 0:7:12.320
<v Wright, Steve>But in Word is quite limited. It's like is it five hours of audio per month, which isn't a lot.</v>

0:7:11.740 --> 0:7:12.940
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah. So.</v>

0:7:13.510 --> 0:7:15.760
<v Wright, Steve>OneDrive must be more, but we don't know how much.</v>

0:7:17.220 --> 0:7:17.790
<v Hurst, Peter>Uh.</v>

0:7:18.770 --> 0:7:20.480
<v Hurst, Peter>I don't think I'm not aware there's a limit.</v>

0:7:21.0 --> 0:7:21.370
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah.</v>

0:7:22.220 --> 0:7:24.900
<v Hurst, Peter>I'm not looking because if you're feeding data into it like this.</v>

0:7:26.900 --> 0:7:29.670
<v Hurst, Peter>As a video and then ask you to transcribe it. Don't think he can.</v>

0:7:30.780 --> 0:7:35.790
<v Hurst, Peter>Ohh suppose I suppose technically it could, but I bet they haven't written a mechanism to to do that because there wasn't one in stream.</v>

0:7:36.530 --> 0:7:36.950
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah.</v>

0:7:36.460 --> 0:7:40.950
<v Hurst, Peter>Which is why I got a shot when I finally get ahold of that tool and it said that 90,000 videos in there.</v>

0:7:42.670 --> 0:7:43.160
<v Wright, Steve>Wow.</v>

0:7:43.520 --> 0:7:43.900
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:7:44.820 --> 0:7:45.490
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah.</v>

0:7:45.360 --> 0:7:47.530
<v Hurst, Peter>And they want to shut it next year, so.</v>

0:7:48.700 --> 0:7:56.380
<v Hurst, Peter>Tomorrow I'm going to take take an hour and go into a room, bang my head against the wall and try and work out what the options are for migration, whether it's to ask you all to.</v>

0:7:57.190 --> 0:8:6.500
<v Hurst, Peter>Migrate your still, whether it's to find migrate it to somewhere you know automatically which could go horribly wrong, or somewhere in between I think.</v>

0:8:8.40 --> 0:8:10.890
<v Wright, Steve>My reckoning is.</v>

0:8:13.770 --> 0:8:18.120
<v Wright, Steve>Ohh, let's think through that. I I assume there's no way of finding out.</v>

0:8:18.970 --> 0:8:22.340
<v Wright, Steve>Viewing figures as distinct from creation.</v>

0:8:21.490 --> 0:8:25.310
<v Hurst, Peter>I I haven't gone that far yet, but yes, that's a good point.</v>

0:8:25.790 --> 0:8:27.460
<v Wright, Steve>Because if you could look at viewing.</v>

0:8:27.530 --> 0:8:28.0
<v Hurst, Peter>Yes.</v>

0:8:28.180 --> 0:8:38.250
<v Wright, Steve>My reckoning is that if you could say have the following, how many of the following videos have been viewed in the last two academic years?</v>

0:8:38.910 --> 0:8:39.100
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:8:42.610 --> 0:8:43.400
<v Hurst, Peter>That's not a bad.</v>

0:8:39.300 --> 0:8:45.690
<v Wright, Steve>That would give you a subset that is a lot smaller because I know that I've got quite a few on there where if you said.</v>

0:8:46.330 --> 0:8:53.280
<v Wright, Steve>Umm do you want us to keep them? I'd say yes. Was it you said? Right. Here's how you do it. I go ********.</v>

0:8:53.490 --> 0:8:53.980
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah, I.</v>

0:8:56.550 --> 0:8:56.850
<v Hurst, Peter>OK.</v>

0:9:2.70 --> 0:9:2.330
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:9:8.580 --> 0:9:8.840
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:9:11.610 --> 0:9:11.920
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:8:55.240 --> 0:9:14.50
<v Wright, Steve>It's not that. Yeah, there's something there, but, but I think there's something about the ones that are embedded in Moodle sites that might have been carried across the year by year. Again, I'm trying to get everyone I can to go get these downloaded, get them onto E stream. If you wanna reuse them. So I'm hoping.</v>

0:9:13.560 --> 0:9:15.420
<v Hurst, Peter>I think that's right, yeah.</v>

0:9:15.800 --> 0:9:27.370
<v Wright, Steve>There will be a nutrition, but to me it would be almost identifying which ones are being watched, getting in contact with the owners of them and saying this has been watching the last two years. I used still using it.</v>

0:9:28.30 --> 0:9:29.380
<v Wright, Steve>You know, do you need some?</v>

0:9:28.90 --> 0:9:36.580
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah. And there's the element of do we have that information and is it Big Brother, if we come around and going, uh, Steve, you've you've done your video as a watch, do we know that?</v>

0:9:37.220 --> 0:9:37.810
<v Hurst, Peter>OK.</v>

0:9:37.750 --> 0:9:41.640
<v Wright, Steve>I I don't know to me if you said it via Moodle. If you said that.</v>

0:9:42.280 --> 0:9:42.940
<v Wright, Steve>Umm.</v>

0:9:44.900 --> 0:9:46.700
<v Wright, Steve>Within Moodle.</v>

0:9:51.10 --> 0:9:51.420
<v Hurst, Peter>Hmm.</v>

0:9:47.450 --> 0:9:55.220
<v Wright, Steve>The this you know, basically we know this service is being switched off. If you tell people we're gonna do it in advance, that shouldn't really.</v>

0:9:55.270 --> 0:10:10.280
<v Hurst, Peter>That's what we're planning through it. If we can give them as much information as possible, I think you're right. I think the viewings would help. If I can do that and say, OK, these we could generate report for every user studies the top 10 videos that you need to worry about and everything else.</v>

0:10:12.310 --> 0:10:12.710
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah.</v>

0:10:12.390 --> 0:10:14.370
<v Hurst, Peter>Maybe that would help, but it's one of the.</v>

0:10:21.240 --> 0:10:22.120
<v Hurst, Peter>Test, yeah.</v>

0:10:22.960 --> 0:10:23.120
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:10:25.220 --> 0:10:25.480
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:10:27.970 --> 0:10:28.860
<v Hurst, Peter>Well, yeah.</v>

0:10:13.890 --> 0:10:29.520
<v Wright, Steve>As I I know that I will have what I mean. I'm not surprised. I've got an absolute shedload because I will have loads of videos like this of me going right? Does this work? I'm just testing this and it could be 2 minutes just to create a VTT. So I've done a lot of testing.</v>

0:10:39.640 --> 0:10:39.950
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah.</v>

0:10:29.680 --> 0:10:40.110
<v Hurst, Peter>That's very clear because somebody else has got 160 videos, but they've got four, I think double no treble. The amount of storage you've used. They're obviously massive videos compared to.</v>

0:10:42.680 --> 0:10:42.920
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah.</v>

0:10:40.650 --> 0:10:45.660
<v Wright, Steve>They'll be like hour long lectures, whereas I have got loads and loads of loads of calls like this.</v>

0:10:44.560 --> 0:10:49.870
<v Hurst, Peter>If you buy, that's what they're there for. But I'm I'm slightly worried about that one because that will take a long time to transfer as well.</v>

0:10:51.70 --> 0:10:51.690
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah.</v>

0:10:51.420 --> 0:11:0.230
<v Hurst, Peter>And they have given it the well the tool, the tool that, that there that did the reporting seems to be based on the tool that we use to move box data.</v>

0:11:1.150 --> 0:11:7.80
<v Hurst, Peter>So it might be that we say actually for people like you who've got larger numbers or people who've got.</v>

0:11:7.980 --> 0:11:10.720
<v Hurst, Peter>Lots of data. We arrange to move it for you.</v>

0:11:12.150 --> 0:11:18.490
<v Hurst, Peter>Or maybe we just do it for all staff and say I would move it into your OneDrive, but I haven't thought that through yet. I don't even know what the tool can do it yet.</v>

0:11:19.280 --> 0:11:21.70
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah, I mean I to me.</v>

0:11:21.860 --> 0:11:32.210
<v Wright, Steve>You would probably move a load of spurious stuff for me now, because it's you've gotta kind of couple of years title. The problem is you know.</v>

0:11:33.140 --> 0:11:47.330
<v Wright, Steve>I I'm moderately pragmatic about it. There would be things that would be a bit annoying to lose, but equally there would be one of those ones again. Yeah, but it's changed by now to me. I've got a lot of teaching from three years ago. But you know what? The software is different now and actually.</v>

0:11:46.900 --> 0:11:47.900
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah, yeah.</v>

0:11:48.540 --> 0:11:52.670
<v Wright, Steve>You know who? Who wants to learn about what you couldn't do three years ago?</v>

0:11:51.580 --> 0:11:54.250
<v Hurst, Peter>We now have pragmatic as you are, though, that's the trouble.</v>

0:11:54.860 --> 0:12:1.150
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah, I have. I have. I have relatively pragmatic, but I mean, I've been trying to.</v>

0:12:1.980 --> 0:12:2.570
<v Wright, Steve>Kind of.</v>

0:12:3.680 --> 0:12:9.580
<v Wright, Steve>Force or push people here towards the stream to get that sorted because.</v>

0:12:10.480 --> 0:12:16.50
<v Wright, Steve>So it might look really bad. It might not be as bad in practice as it looks.</v>

0:12:17.820 --> 0:12:18.530
<v Hurst, Peter>Yeah, I thought.</v>

0:12:17.740 --> 0:12:21.890
<v Wright, Steve>So you can just put book half an hour for bagging your head half an hour for coming up with a plan.</v>

0:12:22.380 --> 0:12:36.620
<v Hurst, Peter>And I think that I think I think you're right. I I don't use it and I do find it incredibly unintuitive. But like you said, muscle memory and just getting used to it and I don't do what you guys do. So it's it's always new to me.</v>

0:12:41.480 --> 0:12:41.720
<v Hurst, Peter>OK.</v>

0:12:37.380 --> 0:12:43.500
<v Wright, Steve>Yeah, right. Well, thank you for this. That has been very, very useful. I'm gonna stop recording now.</v>
