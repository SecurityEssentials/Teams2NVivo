00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.280
Recording.

64db795b-6b69-420c-b0ce-e07606ba2843-0
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.490
Okay.

61a57f17-2107-42eb-a4a8-b17135e1314f-0
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.060
So welcome.

992c692c-e132-45e9-80da-a2287df16dd4-0
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.587
OK, so has been as we talked
about just before. This project

992c692c-e132-45e9-80da-a2287df16dd4-1
00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:25.395
is about friendship, and I'd
like you just to think about one

992c692c-e132-45e9-80da-a2287df16dd4-2
00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:29.450
of your friends and can you tell
me about how you became friends?

b1d0c317-bd02-4981-8f69-710b324f822b-0
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.224
About 6 and just moved over from
Germany and we just happened to

b1d0c317-bd02-4981-8f69-710b324f822b-1
00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:38.680
meet and the first thing he said
to me I know English.

f8b0955b-4f85-4516-ad07-03a7ddb01364-0
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.850
And we have just been friends
with my best friend.

8e4796f2-2a71-43d0-9659-c9a66062ff7d-0
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.359
Ohh OK longest friend as well.
OK so she came over for what?

8e4796f2-2a71-43d0-9659-c9a66062ff7d-1
00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.128
What reason did she come over
to? Her family just moved over

8e4796f2-2a71-43d0-9659-c9a66062ff7d-2
00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:55.897
from Germany. Ohh I see. OK so
she moved over and then she's

8e4796f2-2a71-43d0-9659-c9a66062ff7d-3
00:00:55.897 --> 00:00:59.789
living. Yeah she lives in the
same town as Milton Keynes. Ohh.

8e4796f2-2a71-43d0-9659-c9a66062ff7d-4
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.620
OK right. Ohh yeah. And then how
did that friendship develop?

8e4796f2-2a71-43d0-9659-c9a66062ff7d-5
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.451
Because obviously she came from
a different culture so I just

8e4796f2-2a71-43d0-9659-c9a66062ff7d-6
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:10.850
kept bugging her and asking her
what's this in German?

70bd10bb-f543-4ab5-a632-77f7aa0c1753-0
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.800
Get stuff with me and not help
her out and she'd help.

05f8eb2e-0ee5-46db-a517-2e1c50dd1e87-0
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.704
Can you find me sleeping better
better. Not just best friends

05f8eb2e-0ee5-46db-a517-2e1c50dd1e87-1
00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:22.462
now ohh. OK yeah so that. So
it's kind of like a mutual

05f8eb2e-0ee5-46db-a517-2e1c50dd1e87-2
00:01:22.462 --> 00:01:25.172
learning for both of you.
Everything together as well.

05f8eb2e-0ee5-46db-a517-2e1c50dd1e87-3
00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.980
Like everything that happened to
her for the first time.

91bb40d7-4448-425b-950f-b4f2534e4c9e-0
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330
Well, what do I do for this? And
then I'd help her.

f5d5b028-c40e-4c2c-9f37-2bb1f8ff1f30-0
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.898
So is that more with school work
or more personal? Both things

f5d5b028-c40e-4c2c-9f37-2bb1f8ff1f30-1
00:01:41.898 --> 00:01:45.690
like start with school work
because like really young, not

f5d5b028-c40e-4c2c-9f37-2bb1f8ff1f30-2
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.803
really not much happens to you,
but yeah, like first boyfriends

f5d5b028-c40e-4c2c-9f37-2bb1f8ff1f30-3
00:01:49.803 --> 00:01:51.410
and things like that and.

497eef0f-cd55-4c57-8a6e-9217ea5891d0-0
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.940
Going out?

f5395a8d-7c4d-48da-810c-6f6400a53ec5-0
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.080
Doing everything you don't want
to.

e2833697-83f6-402a-b580-8f18fba92d26-0
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.677
So you are more of you because
you were the older one? Yeah,

e2833697-83f6-402a-b580-8f18fba92d26-1
00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:05.241
you sort of did. You feel like
you took her under your wing for

e2833697-83f6-402a-b580-8f18fba92d26-2
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.638
some things, but a lot of it,
she matured faster than me for

e2833697-83f6-402a-b580-8f18fba92d26-3
00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:12.091
somethings. For them, it's like
she took me under her wing as

e2833697-83f6-402a-b580-8f18fba92d26-4
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:12.370
well.

aa6dc420-a13d-44c8-af82-db13d1b86e7b-0
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.640
Yeah, yeah. OK and then did you
learn quite a lot of German

aa6dc420-a13d-44c8-af82-db13d1b86e7b-1
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.790
then? Yeah, I'm getting a ruler.
GC. Ohh. Really.

2dc83b51-2d6b-47b0-ba38-5425fecdff9b-0
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.950
Because of her, she likes to
think so.

21f0c954-f5d1-4dcf-9732-a597952fc283-0
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.320
Just give it that one.

996744d2-7a4b-4210-aa1f-059fa213fa2f-0
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.640
Um, so.

b0f5ce65-0d20-4817-a231-eeaa200b7c6c-0
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.260
Okay, so, so, so my friend said
she was six.

14fec313-163b-4f05-ab4f-032dff977a28-0
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.415
So what? What kind of things do
you do with your friends? What

14fec313-163b-4f05-ab4f-032dff977a28-1
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:43.240
kind of things would you do with
her? We've tried making up diets

14fec313-163b-4f05-ab4f-032dff977a28-2
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.893
because of the past three years.
We've been saying that we're

14fec313-163b-4f05-ab4f-032dff977a28-3
00:02:45.893 --> 00:02:48.546
gonna die and we're gonna go on
holiday. It's gonna be really

14fec313-163b-4f05-ab4f-032dff977a28-4
00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:51.370
good, but this has not happened.
And then we used to go swimming,

14fec313-163b-4f05-ab4f-032dff977a28-5
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.852
but then we end up just going
and getting like a kebab or

14fec313-163b-4f05-ab4f-032dff977a28-6
00:02:53.852 --> 00:02:54.280
something.

7041865d-f5e4-4db1-9d61-143d09e6c81f-0
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.310
Worry about any good that we
did, and we're just.

e19405f3-3b82-4dff-a23d-a9e3e6dbc24a-0
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.320
Watch films and go out for a
drive or something.

969ff037-dbf5-418b-b07b-89da505440d1-0
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.196
Any little thing would just sit
there for hours just talking and

969ff037-dbf5-418b-b07b-89da505440d1-1
00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:08.840
doing nothing.

8d30551d-e3ae-4904-ab00-b2c17a70f2a4-0
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.080
To spend hours just trying on
different hats.

0902b2dc-4cee-427d-8e46-1dda3ec1ae41-0
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.890
Yeah, that's what we do, yeah.

3b4b18bc-1bd5-4bc9-ada1-396fca3d28b1-0
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.775
And do you feel that friendship
has changed since you've been at

3b4b18bc-1bd5-4bc9-ada1-396fca3d28b1-1
00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:27.209
university? I thought it would
actually quite worried that

3b4b18bc-1bd5-4bc9-ada1-396fca3d28b1-2
00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:27.660
cause.

492fc69e-dd12-4d69-8665-f12c5cdc30da-0
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.474
All my friends went to Uni a
year before I did like all my

492fc69e-dd12-4d69-8665-f12c5cdc30da-1
00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:34.590
school friends and.

05cb6d7a-97f1-4e98-b8e9-6bc03d7a6a0c-0
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.282
I grew apart from practically
what those group of six of us

05cb6d7a-97f1-4e98-b8e9-6bc03d7a6a0c-1
00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:42.465
and I grew apart from all of
them apart from 2. And I was a

05cb6d7a-97f1-4e98-b8e9-6bc03d7a6a0c-2
00:03:42.465 --> 00:03:45.701
bit gutted that happened. I
thought that was going to happen

05cb6d7a-97f1-4e98-b8e9-6bc03d7a6a0c-3
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:48.990
with her. Like when I went to
you when I came to it was fine.

05cb6d7a-97f1-4e98-b8e9-6bc03d7a6a0c-4
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.120
It was, it was pretty much the
same because we'd have like

05cb6d7a-97f1-4e98-b8e9-6bc03d7a6a0c-5
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.302
times would see each other
everyday for a week and would be

05cb6d7a-97f1-4e98-b8e9-6bc03d7a6a0c-6
00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.690
living with each other
practically but then.

e1f3f977-9f60-4d0b-855d-b0f1bbe6b6a7-0
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.733
Do you have for like a month or
something? This is kind of like

e1f3f977-9f60-4d0b-855d-b0f1bbe6b6a7-1
00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:04.227
that. Like so whenever I go home
I always make a point to like

e1f3f977-9f60-4d0b-855d-b0f1bbe6b6a7-2
00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:04.900
meet up with her.

e73a187f-e210-477c-ac63-271126078526-0
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.568
Didn't even see you come gone
all the time. Just seems like

e73a187f-e210-477c-ac63-271126078526-1
00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:12.625
cause was texting and calling
anyway, so you've always got

e73a187f-e210-477c-ac63-271126078526-2
00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.890
that thing between us. Are used
to be worried, but I'm not OK.

121bee5e-92f4-4d3e-af2e-c9b94e5d50e6-0
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.524
And that that you mentioned that
feeling of going home and

121bee5e-92f4-4d3e-af2e-c9b94e5d50e6-1
00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:24.616
feeling like you've just caught
up where you left off. Do you

121bee5e-92f4-4d3e-af2e-c9b94e5d50e6-2
00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:28.708
think how important do you think
that is in a friendship very

121bee5e-92f4-4d3e-af2e-c9b94e5d50e6-3
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.470
because there's that gap between
you when it seems that.

c4ac361d-11cb-4f91-8c39-b66538d0d9f3-0
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.297
He's got a lot to catch up on. I
think it's good because then you

c4ac361d-11cb-4f91-8c39-b66538d0d9f3-1
00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:40.335
can like each other in your
lives and stuff. But then I like

c4ac361d-11cb-4f91-8c39-b66538d0d9f3-2
00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:43.174
the fact that doesn't seem that
I have to start from the

c4ac361d-11cb-4f91-8c39-b66538d0d9f3-3
00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:46.163
beginning again because it's
just like this, just literally

c4ac361d-11cb-4f91-8c39-b66538d0d9f3-4
00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:49.052
just carrying on from where he
left off. Yeah, instead of

c4ac361d-11cb-4f91-8c39-b66538d0d9f3-5
00:04:49.052 --> 00:04:52.040
having like to like, reexplain
on the stories. Like all the

c4ac361d-11cb-4f91-8c39-b66538d0d9f3-6
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.829
people in the stories, she knows
all about them anyway.

8f3b35bc-e85e-4fc9-9ba7-130efeeda189-0
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.063
Go like my miles back and say,
yeah, this person did this, but

8f3b35bc-e85e-4fc9-9ba7-130efeeda189-1
00:05:01.063 --> 00:05:04.151
like this year they they did
that and stuff so I don't have

8f3b35bc-e85e-4fc9-9ba7-130efeeda189-2
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:05.490
to do that with her. Yeah.

deeee1aa-1415-4fa9-90b6-1039e65f1bc6-0
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.743
Yeah, and how, how important has
it been to you to maintain that

deeee1aa-1415-4fa9-90b6-1039e65f1bc6-1
00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:14.420
friendship at university? Pretty
important, cause you've got a

deeee1aa-1415-4fa9-90b6-1039e65f1bc6-2
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.864
threat like quite cool thing is,
cause I've got like close

deeee1aa-1415-4fa9-90b6-1039e65f1bc6-3
00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:19.440
friends, I don't have that.

d266a0a1-b6bd-4603-8f01-73842bf6e9d6-0
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.290
Friends that.

bea3d5e5-1bdf-4837-9fa6-4fbaf87796fc-0
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.130
But.

5f46dadf-0a56-4b62-bf9c-060d83ed5ce3-0
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.803
Yeah, I tend to have close
friends, so maintain those close

5f46dadf-0a56-4b62-bf9c-060d83ed5ce3-1
00:05:28.803 --> 00:05:32.253
friendships. That means more to
me because I've always got that

5f46dadf-0a56-4b62-bf9c-060d83ed5ce3-2
00:05:32.253 --> 00:05:35.703
thing to go back on, and I know
that there's always that person

5f46dadf-0a56-4b62-bf9c-060d83ed5ce3-3
00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:37.320
there for me maintaining that.

5e20c52f-23c8-4f5f-b894-7697dbe96405-0
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.545
To feel safe and good, yeah.
Yeah. So maintaining the old

5e20c52f-23c8-4f5f-b894-7697dbe96405-1
00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:47.427
friendships that you've got, did
you find when you came to

5e20c52f-23c8-4f5f-b894-7697dbe96405-2
00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:48.480
university that?

d954a804-0525-4de4-8ac9-a30544c3f0ce-0
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.212
There was a big change with this
particular close friend. Or did

d954a804-0525-4de4-8ac9-a30544c3f0ce-1
00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:54.570
you find that you've always?

57865012-4e59-43a3-bda3-d57140c9638c-0
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.690
Just a little stage.

f69c2164-2998-4323-960d-a41f3ab38d5b-0
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.160
Okay.

45859375-f443-4b3b-9ed5-4e1114b9aab4-0
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.000
Okay. And then so you mentioned
how you pass time with friends,

45859375-f443-4b3b-9ed5-4e1114b9aab4-1
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.630
so that can be anything from
trying on hats.

69e547a2-462f-4685-b460-ddf51316f48b-0
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.895
Just generally sort of passing
the time. Is that how you spend

69e547a2-462f-4685-b460-ddf51316f48b-1
00:06:11.895 --> 00:06:13.320
time with other friends as well?

01cca070-3080-4931-ab07-51ff4a2aaca5-0
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.601
But some friends that always
feel that I need to have

01cca070-3080-4931-ab07-51ff4a2aaca5-1
00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:22.717
something specific to do,
otherwise we're gonna get bored

01cca070-3080-4931-ab07-51ff4a2aaca5-2
00:06:22.717 --> 00:06:22.930
or.

2bd70c80-2e3d-4ffd-bd52-c16524f10813-0
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.731
Just like when this kind of
awkward silences or when, well,

2bd70c80-2e3d-4ffd-bd52-c16524f10813-1
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:31.195
cause I'm with my friends at
home, when there's silence, it's

2bd70c80-2e3d-4ffd-bd52-c16524f10813-2
00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:34.379
doesn't matter cause we both
know that there's something

2bd70c80-2e3d-4ffd-bd52-c16524f10813-3
00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.011
going on in our heads and we're
just thinking of stories to like

2bd70c80-2e3d-4ffd-bd52-c16524f10813-4
00:06:38.011 --> 00:06:41.474
tell each other and things like
that. But with some friends I

2bd70c80-2e3d-4ffd-bd52-c16524f10813-5
00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:44.938
found it always seems that when
there's a feel that I have to

2bd70c80-2e3d-4ffd-bd52-c16524f10813-6
00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:46.000
break that silence.

9a10cb37-87a3-467e-a2e1-84fab38d2e53-0
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.700
Just watching TV.

5bd70f3f-2a15-410e-8086-7c2c6cb61ffb-0
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.510
Because actually doing something
specific rather than.

3ff2ef85-1c62-402d-8b7b-527ca7d46213-0
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.483
Just sitting there and doing
nothing. I don't feel that I can

3ff2ef85-1c62-402d-8b7b-527ca7d46213-1
00:06:55.483 --> 00:06:56.240
do that with everyone.

f87d3678-d48c-4a73-858e-e8d1cf4782ac-0
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.400
Yeah.

8db267b0-0f17-4a02-be37-e21136591a5e-0
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.159
So to you, that's an important
sign of friendships, that

8db267b0-0f17-4a02-be37-e21136591a5e-1
00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:05.833
ability to feel comfortable.
Yeah, in that silence and that

8db267b0-0f17-4a02-be37-e21136591a5e-2
00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:09.813
that ability, do you feel when,
when do you feel that happens in

8db267b0-0f17-4a02-be37-e21136591a5e-3
00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:13.180
a friendship? Do you feel
there's a certain point that

8db267b0-0f17-4a02-be37-e21136591a5e-4
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.160
that happens or?

8febd364-b276-4686-abae-664476d12eb7-0
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.300
Well, I think that.

9371728f-8a4c-466c-abe8-215a2df00ab0-0
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.810
If it's going to be, that's
always gonna be cause.

bd72cf7d-e683-49fe-81e9-ce1ad800af05-0
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.975
I would like to hear that long,
but I've never thought a whole

bd72cf7d-e683-49fe-81e9-ce1ad800af05-1
00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:27.156
time that I've known her. I've
never felt that. It's been

bd72cf7d-e683-49fe-81e9-ce1ad800af05-2
00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:30.501
awkward. It's from day one,
since the first six. It's always

bd72cf7d-e683-49fe-81e9-ce1ad800af05-3
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:31.049
been that.

43876bf2-2541-4171-abc4-78bd3b1f12ac-0
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.542
Yeah, I had to make any specific
efforts like talk and make sure

43876bf2-2541-4171-abc4-78bd3b1f12ac-1
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:42.000
that I'm keeping it happy and
I'm not leaving around.

016d7c7a-3686-4ddc-b3c1-5c4eb97a976b-0
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.302
Yeah. And it's so is that
something that you feel with

016d7c7a-3686-4ddc-b3c1-5c4eb97a976b-1
00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.190
other friendships is missing?
Yeah.

0340efbb-b0f8-446b-945d-9144e5bb3490-0
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.133
I wish that I could be like that
with all friendships, but I know

0340efbb-b0f8-446b-945d-9144e5bb3490-1
00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:56.727
that it's not going. Yeah. Cause
you don't always have not always

0340efbb-b0f8-446b-945d-9144e5bb3490-2
00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:59.243
best friends with every single
person that you know that you're

0340efbb-b0f8-446b-945d-9144e5bb3490-3
00:07:59.243 --> 00:07:59.990
friends with. Yeah.

bbf2c3c8-3dd3-4d0e-9c9a-ae9b271bdbbf-0
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:01.840
Yeah.

ae3cbfae-029d-494c-86ca-2a6926d1a4c6-0
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.244
And then did she go to
university as well? She's going,

ae3cbfae-029d-494c-86ca-2a6926d1a4c6-1
00:08:06.244 --> 00:08:10.350
she, she reset you as well. This
is what we do, OK? She wrote. We

ae3cbfae-029d-494c-86ca-2a6926d1a4c6-2
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.270
spent a year as well, but she
was academically, she was a year

ae3cbfae-029d-494c-86ca-2a6926d1a4c6-3
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.830
below me.

a31eb7a7-0820-452a-ae88-8a7170d28f8d-0
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.880
Now she's going to uni next
year.

e2896937-92e1-4da4-833a-12f9562c656a-0
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.170
At the end of September.

97ab8d4d-e75b-4bce-80e0-466f7e7441bf-0
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.655
So as she talked about her sort
of, you know, feelings about how

97ab8d4d-e75b-4bce-80e0-466f7e7441bf-1
00:08:27.655 --> 00:08:30.722
she feels about yeah, it's the
first thing she said was like,

97ab8d4d-e75b-4bce-80e0-466f7e7441bf-2
00:08:30.722 --> 00:08:33.690
ohh, you have to come and like
stay with me during freshers

97ab8d4d-e75b-4bce-80e0-466f7e7441bf-3
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.757
week. But I said no because in
freshers week, that's when you

97ab8d4d-e75b-4bce-80e0-466f7e7441bf-4
00:08:36.757 --> 00:08:39.775
make all your friends and all
your first experience. Also, I

97ab8d4d-e75b-4bce-80e0-466f7e7441bf-5
00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:42.150
said I'll come work three months
into the year.

14c8b4b2-1634-45e7-b6bf-b38168086f68-0
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.068
Yeah, then it would be. I
wouldn't have exams and stuff

14c8b4b2-1634-45e7-b6bf-b38168086f68-1
00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:49.216
yet, but I'll still be able to
go there and spend some time

14c8b4b2-1634-45e7-b6bf-b38168086f68-2
00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:52.575
with them. Yeah, yeah, but we've
already made plans cause she's

14c8b4b2-1634-45e7-b6bf-b38168086f68-3
00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:52.890
going.

06afd5b6-9142-424c-b65e-5b51b6097e90-0
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.651
And when I drive past on the
way, so would you make plans

06afd5b6-9142-424c-b65e-5b51b6097e90-1
00:08:56.651 --> 00:08:58.810
that we're gonna go up and down
all the time?

2b3adf2f-148a-4425-add1-e779cd2b0db2-0
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.485
There's a good halfway point to
to me and meet up and things and

2b3adf2f-148a-4425-add1-e779cd2b0db2-1
00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:06.559
how how how did she respond when
you said when you mentioned

2b3adf2f-148a-4425-add1-e779cd2b0db2-2
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:09.633
suggested this about going off
after three months instead of

2b3adf2f-148a-4425-add1-e779cd2b0db2-3
00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:12.757
the first. Yeah she's, she's
she's like, yeah actually you're

2b3adf2f-148a-4425-add1-e779cd2b0db2-4
00:09:12.757 --> 00:09:13.060
right.

d737d806-4fdf-4936-921b-5599c20d6ff3-0
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.860


26ab5fa2-4695-45f3-9c01-a7bdb9b17d8f-0
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.947
But I think that's a sign of a
really good friend as well,

26ab5fa2-4695-45f3-9c01-a7bdb9b17d8f-1
00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:22.960
because I think you're right and
it can be quite scary going to

26ab5fa2-4695-45f3-9c01-a7bdb9b17d8f-2
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.750
university and you want those
people.

07d356d7-534f-47db-861c-29a50a160814-0
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.010
It's always easy to, like, go
back to you.

f5ad0af2-6924-4187-9397-bb422945b5e1-0
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.715
Comfort zone. But I'd be her
comfort zone because they'd be a

f5ad0af2-6924-4187-9397-bb422945b5e1-1
00:09:31.715 --> 00:09:34.771
new thing. But then I think that
she needs to be thrown into the

f5ad0af2-6924-4187-9397-bb422945b5e1-2
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.828
deep end a bit when it comes to
things like that, because she is

f5ad0af2-6924-4187-9397-bb422945b5e1-3
00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:40.837
really good at making friends.
She's confident, she's good like

f5ad0af2-6924-4187-9397-bb422945b5e1-4
00:09:40.837 --> 00:09:43.706
that. But I think when you're at
uni you was especially your

f5ad0af2-6924-4187-9397-bb422945b5e1-5
00:09:43.706 --> 00:09:45.540
first night that first night I
was at.

5de34316-e044-4220-aa40-ddb91d1b3265-0
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:48.600
But.

ce3b4b51-8072-4211-abee-239643696696-0
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.952
I think that you need to have
that push to actually go out and

ce3b4b51-8072-4211-abee-239643696696-1
00:09:51.952 --> 00:09:54.908
make friends, because otherwise
just gonna be so lonely the

ce3b4b51-8072-4211-abee-239643696696-2
00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:55.450
whole time.

24514b02-4c9b-4726-a340-f6c8399e82fe-0
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.990
An experience as much like going
out and doing stupid things.

295cc4a4-f4e3-4b3b-b239-34fcb8fa8b88-0
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.537
So how do you think she felt
when you first came to

295cc4a4-f4e3-4b3b-b239-34fcb8fa8b88-1
00:10:07.537 --> 00:10:10.991
university and knew you talked
about your friends that you've

295cc4a4-f4e3-4b3b-b239-34fcb8fa8b88-2
00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:11.270
made?

8eadba65-7a5a-427f-8db0-78295cf6bbeb-0
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.590
She's already gone.

270d1fb3-1eae-4fea-b9dd-727d01c4d9ae-0
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.049
Is the one that worries me. When
I was like when I told you that,

270d1fb3-1eae-4fea-b9dd-727d01c4d9ae-1
00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:21.055
I was worried about when cause I
told her about halfway through

270d1fb3-1eae-4fea-b9dd-727d01c4d9ae-2
00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:23.731
my first year. I told her I
can't. I'm really was really

270d1fb3-1eae-4fea-b9dd-727d01c4d9ae-3
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:26.502
worried that we're gonna grab
part of something bad. We're

270d1fb3-1eae-4fea-b9dd-727d01c4d9ae-4
00:10:26.502 --> 00:10:27.160
gonna grow up.

5ffa7d4c-1868-46c9-b20f-f0edcb6e69e0-0
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.830
Enough.

f4a8e3bf-bfe2-44b2-8c4f-9f97b3fc626e-0
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.012
She's fine. She just, as long as
I keep going, keep her updated

f4a8e3bf-bfe2-44b2-8c4f-9f97b3fc626e-1
00:10:34.012 --> 00:10:35.870
with stories and stuff, she
doesn't really.

0ec48c8b-9b3f-40b5-b162-9ed23dc45e3e-0
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.599
Yeah, yeah. And how how does she
is? She talked about how she

0ec48c8b-9b3f-40b5-b162-9ed23dc45e3e-1
00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:44.430
feels since you've gone.

9ce93db2-87ff-4024-ad40-5a7d4da18ffa-0
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.230
Nothing really changed.

f84ad028-bf8c-41f4-80c0-7e0e839b5014-0
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.300
The other different.

a6070a47-d838-4064-84d9-f4c693fe8632-0
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.320
Just you just make sure she
gets.

7ba5ee6e-97b2-4149-a998-632f75bae419-0
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.070
When I go home.

583d0df1-4add-496c-aa0b-9e6330a310cb-0
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.687
Family gatherings something.
Alright, have time to meet up

583d0df1-4add-496c-aa0b-9e6330a310cb-1
00:11:04.687 --> 00:11:07.360
with her and stuff. And he
didn't meet me up all this.

2922848c-1edc-4bfb-941d-05a4d90b077a-0
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.350
Ohh.

3f5d5776-9c3b-44ed-875f-7da48b29e73e-0
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.420
And.

830bcccb-4d21-4e97-9c9b-0b0070d610d4-0
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.673
How do you feel sometimes when
you can't always fit through

830bcccb-4d21-4e97-9c9b-0b0070d610d4-1
00:11:15.673 --> 00:11:16.380
when you go home?

b3134653-aa06-40cb-a3f1-b9d4a49ed422-0
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.380
Charity.

72e48c6b-a8a2-463b-a811-28b10778cd73-0
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.560
Like I really want to, but.

65f8059b-7b45-47e9-b301-5b435732c1aa-0
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.070
I know that next time I go home,
always make up for it.

8654e508-5908-463b-8149-fce6dc20d58f-0
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.070
We're gonna do things. We've got
the whole summer anyway to do

8654e508-5908-463b-8149-fce6dc20d58f-1
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.249
things. Yeah. So it's not really
gonna go well, but she knows

8654e508-5908-463b-8149-fce6dc20d58f-2
00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:40.300
that I would meet her if I
could. Yeah.

a68f560a-6d33-4734-9685-77b615cc62bf-0
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.550
Okay and and and.

3769624e-3415-4178-9630-e49ab988f847-0
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.571
Is there someone sort of that
you've met because obviously met

3769624e-3415-4178-9630-e49ab988f847-1
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:52.711
people at university. How did
you find when you first came to

3769624e-3415-4178-9630-e49ab988f847-2
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.890
university in terms of making
new friends?

365ad68b-f6d3-4fd8-8092-d074a8f54f34-0
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.830
I made quite quite a few quite
fast cause because I lived in.

5322f73b-4c94-485f-9d52-817b0b414ece-0
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.750
Liverpool, OK?

dda7351b-6c43-4716-96b4-69d18ff167ba-0
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.985
You're on my floor. We will end
up like for the first two weeks

dda7351b-6c43-4716-96b4-69d18ff167ba-1
00:12:11.985 --> 00:12:13.030
we all went out together.

fbb88ba0-4823-4307-a6e6-d78d5a61a261-0
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.806
The whole floor like 12 went out
together. They all became quite

fbb88ba0-4823-4307-a6e6-d78d5a61a261-1
00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:22.792
close in that week, on the 1st 2
weeks and then after that it all

fbb88ba0-4823-4307-a6e6-d78d5a61a261-2
00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:26.658
started. Like all the girls, we
all stayed close, about five of

fbb88ba0-4823-4307-a6e6-d78d5a61a261-3
00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:26.840
us.

579a3f35-9432-4d90-a438-5fabde57c885-0
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.750
Pretty nasty.

4c12333b-df71-4d63-9fbe-dbaf140984fd-0
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.480
Yeah.

b2508b32-908a-4472-9969-5ff6db4c99ba-0
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.630
Toilet seat.

50320ac1-1f8b-4363-a127-38f4c87d2afe-0
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.680
Yeah. And then.

39630b3a-f8ed-4cd3-a8d9-158ed31b8417-0
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.715
Watch TV or something. But then
none of those were my calls. But

39630b3a-f8ed-4cd3-a8d9-158ed31b8417-1
00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:50.600
then the two like the two girls
I met on my course.

f635587f-2a23-4485-bbdc-31e303d5d06f-0
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.340
The same as me.

573686ae-e4f1-4d1f-a439-2b7dec5ffe10-0
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.360
The three of us just spent the
whole last year.

fc59129d-f491-491f-9855-c388bc643109-0
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.927
And like cause we've got pretty
much everyday and the girls on

fc59129d-f491-491f-9855-c388bc643109-1
00:13:04.927 --> 00:13:08.164
my floor, they didn't really go
out that often. So in that way I

fc59129d-f491-491f-9855-c388bc643109-2
00:13:08.164 --> 00:13:11.351
kind of grew apart from them and
I got close to the other team,

fc59129d-f491-491f-9855-c388bc643109-3
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:11.800
but then.

81f86fab-8e37-4c34-8b79-d12cef9d4de4-0
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.110
On the same floor as the other
girls, there was like that

81f86fab-8e37-4c34-8b79-d12cef9d4de4-1
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.330
balance between the two, but I.

9565237c-f16b-4368-9719-2f1218d9eee5-0
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.841
With the two girls on my course,
I seem closer than always make

9565237c-f16b-4368-9719-2f1218d9eee5-1
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:23.609
more of an effort to go to their
rooms and go to their part of

9565237c-f16b-4368-9719-2f1218d9eee5-2
00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:24.620
the walls and children.

0234f210-2516-4c6f-b4a2-9cdc7e77858d-0
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.648
And then so, so why? So what's
the difference, do you think,

0234f210-2516-4c6f-b4a2-9cdc7e77858d-1
00:13:29.648 --> 00:13:32.327
between that initial group of
friends and the group, the two

0234f210-2516-4c6f-b4a2-9cdc7e77858d-2
00:13:32.327 --> 00:13:34.260
girls that you stayed more in
contact with?

85717fb9-d807-4703-a745-55d5a0b0fbb5-0
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.371
I think it is that common
interest of having a crazy first

85717fb9-d807-4703-a745-55d5a0b0fbb5-1
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:42.821
year and yeah, it's going wild
and doing absolutely everything,

85717fb9-d807-4703-a745-55d5a0b0fbb5-2
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:46.110
but you can do cause there I
suppose the girls and my father

85717fb9-d807-4703-a745-55d5a0b0fbb5-3
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.400
a lot more sensible and the fact
that they like they worked.

b36be7d0-a2ef-42bd-8847-225dc177c075-0
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.960
They worked with balances.

68825489-21e4-4080-bde6-bfd1063d7fc5-0
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:54.960
Dodgy.

d89193bc-1620-42e6-be3c-ea0c780b373f-0
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.270
Just cause.

142dd0c0-d7a2-4a84-a1a2-c292a62c2b30-0
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.523
All of our experiences when
we're out and stuff as well that

142dd0c0-d7a2-4a84-a1a2-c292a62c2b30-1
00:14:02.523 --> 00:14:05.935
things that happen without that
brought us to like quite close

142dd0c0-d7a2-4a84-a1a2-c292a62c2b30-2
00:14:05.935 --> 00:14:06.640
together and.

5d57523b-b4f7-4009-a89e-cfcbcff7e66e-0
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.380
I suppose because.

12397929-262d-46f3-bb8e-44df5029357d-0
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.981
Those two are Asian as well on
my course. So there was the

12397929-262d-46f3-bb8e-44df5029357d-1
00:14:13.981 --> 00:14:16.000
other common factor that kind
of.

a16fc0e0-ecc6-4902-a39d-9f5b4f241d8c-0
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.728
It's a bit sad that happens
sometimes, I think, but it just

a16fc0e0-ecc6-4902-a39d-9f5b4f241d8c-1
00:14:20.728 --> 00:14:24.444
does. And you just tend to gel a
bit more because there's like

a16fc0e0-ecc6-4902-a39d-9f5b4f241d8c-2
00:14:24.444 --> 00:14:28.218
that cultural understanding as
well, because like with my girls

a16fc0e0-ecc6-4902-a39d-9f5b4f241d8c-3
00:14:28.218 --> 00:14:31.934
on the floor there was a Chinese
girl like black person white,

a16fc0e0-ecc6-4902-a39d-9f5b4f241d8c-4
00:14:31.934 --> 00:14:33.349
but I think with Asians.

a20e5fe7-d94b-47c9-a753-791cb05a788f-0
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.755
Does anyone like people of your
own race and stuff like cultures

a20e5fe7-d94b-47c9-a753-791cb05a788f-1
00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:40.942
that are similar to you as they
seem to understand you more?

a20e5fe7-d94b-47c9-a753-791cb05a788f-2
00:14:40.942 --> 00:14:42.510
Yeah, like this understanding.

d1b0d898-4a62-4079-aa4c-409e876b3b6b-0
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.080
I think that's why.

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-0
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.282
So do you feel like they
understood you better perhaps

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-1
00:14:49.282 --> 00:14:52.533
than the other people that
you've met? What thing is that

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-2
00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:56.120
that I did it first and but by
that time I was really close but

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-3
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.651
then with the others I started
realising that they know me and

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-4
00:14:59.651 --> 00:15:02.789
they understand me just as
nearly as much but even like

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-5
00:15:02.789 --> 00:15:05.704
cause themes with like
boyfriends and stuff because

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-6
00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:09.011
I've seen all parents can't
know. But my other like not my

66b38595-cb52-4d97-8761-79c4bc45a1bc-7
00:15:09.011 --> 00:15:10.020
non Asian friends.
