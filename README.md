# Convert Teams and Zoom Transcripts to NVivo

This utility converts an automated transcript created by the online video conference services [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), or OneDrive (undocumented feature for video) to support the popular qualitative analysis tool [NVivo](https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo-qualitative-data-analysis-software/home). It provides extra options so as to make coding and analysis as easy as possible.

See [the hosted pages on Github Pages](https://securityessentials.github.io/Teams2NVivo/index.html ) for instructions and usage.
